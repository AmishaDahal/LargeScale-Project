You are starting with zero points on this assignment because your code did not 
run properly and appears to be untested in its script form. I want you to get 
some credit here, so I'll give you 70% of the points back if you fix your code
and resubmit it by Tuesday, November 5th at 3:00pm. Please email me to set up
a meeting (either in person or over Zoom). I want to discuss what went wrong 
and fix it.
